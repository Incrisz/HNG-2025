# Stage 3A Task

## Task Objective
In this stage, the interns will work in groups (groups will be posted in the private channel) to design a setup for **backend.im** that allows code to be executed, tested, and deployed dynamically. The system should provide a structured way to deploy and test backend code in isolated environments. Each deployment will be handled within a Kubernetes namespace containing:

- A pod for the application
- A pod for the database
- A pod for the testing application
- A pod for the testing database

## Requirements

### Architecture Proposal

#### System Design Submission
- **Design a system architecture** that outlines how backends will be generated and deployed.
- **Document all key components**, including Kubernetes resources, API gateway, and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Submit the architecture** for approval via the designated form or channel.

#### Approval Process
- The proposal will be reviewed by mentors, who will provide feedback.
- Once approved, you can proceed with implementation (this will be the next task).

The architecture should cover the following areas:

#### Infrastructure Setup
- Use Kubernetes to manage namespaces and pods for applications, databases, and testing environments.
- Set up an API gateway to handle requests and route them correctly.
- Configure Kubernetes services for internal communication.

#### Code Deployment
- Implement a structured deployment process for backend services.
- Ensure proper validation and database updates during deployment.
- Test deployed endpoints and report results to the main system.

#### State Management
- Move successfully tested code to production pods and validate the deployment.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system should dynamically create and deploy backend services based on user input.
- A clear and detailed architectural diagram of the entire system must be provided.
- You must be prepared to explain your design and implementation decisions to mentors.

### Submission Mode
- Create a detailed architectural document along with presentation slides.

## Interview Process
After submission, you will be interviewed by DevOps mentors. Be ready to discuss:
- Your architecture design and the rationale behind your choices.
- How the system ensures reliability and functionality.
- The challenges you faced and how you addressed them.

> **Note:** This stage only involves designing the setup; implementation is not required at this point.
