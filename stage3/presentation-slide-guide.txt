Title Slide

Project name (e.g., Stage 3A Architecture)
Your group members’ names
Overview

Briefly state the task objective (what the system is meant to accomplish).
Summarize the key points: dynamic creation of backends, isolated test environments, and deployment.
High-Level Architecture

Show your main architecture diagram (the same one from your documentation).
Point out the Kubernetes namespaces (test vs. production), pods, CI/CD flow, and traffic routing.
Infrastructure Components

List the Kubernetes resources (namespaces, pods, services, ingress).
Mention the database, testing application, and any load balancers or gateways.
CI/CD Pipeline

Show how code moves from commit → build → test → deploy.
Highlight any automated testing or validation steps.
Blue-Green / Test–Prod Approach

Emphasize how the system handles updates with minimal downtime.
Explain the promotion process from test pods to production pods.
Reliability and Monitoring

Mention how logs, metrics, or monitoring tools are integrated (if applicable).
Briefly explain rollback or fallback strategies (in case something fails in production).
Summary / Q&A

Recap the benefits: dynamic deployments, testing in isolated environments, easy rollbacks.
Provide time for questions from mentors or the audience.
Tip: Keep slides concise and visual—focus on diagrams, bullet points, and short explanations rather than text-heavy slides. This ensures your presentation is clear and engaging.
